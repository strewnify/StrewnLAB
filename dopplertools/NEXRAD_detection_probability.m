function P_d = NEXRAD_detection_probability(object_area_m2, slantRange_m)
    % NEXRAD_detection_probability calculates the probability of detection for an object in a radar beam.
    %
    % Inputs:
    %   object_area_m2 - The effective area of the object (in mÂ²) as seen by the radar
    %   slantRange_m - The slant range from the radar to the object (in meters)
    %
    % Output:
    %   P_d - The probability of detection (value between 0 and 1)
    
    % Assumptions
    lambda = 0.1; % Wavelength of radar in meters (S-band ~ 3 GHz)
    Pt = 750e3;   % Transmitted power in watts (750 kW)
    Gt = 45;      % Antenna gain (dB)
    Gr = 45;      % Receiver antenna gain (dB)
    L = 3;        % System losses (dB)
    N = -110;     % Noise power (dBm)
    B = 1e6;      % Bandwidth (1 MHz)
    beam_width_deg = 1; % NEXRAD beam width assumption in degrees
    detection_threshold_dB = -10; % Updated detection threshold in dB
    
    % Convert gain and losses from dB to linear scale
    Gt_linear = 10^(Gt / 10);
    Gr_linear = 10^(Gr / 10);
    L_linear = 10^(L / 10);
    
    % Convert noise power from dBm to watts
    N_linear = 10^(N / 10) / 1000;
    
    % Calculate radar beam cross-sectional area at the slant range
    beam_width_rad = deg2rad(beam_width_deg); % Convert beam width to radians
    beam_area_m2 = pi * (slantRange_m^2) * beam_width_rad;
    
    % Ensure the object area is within the beam cross-sectional area
    effective_area_m2 = min(object_area_m2, beam_area_m2);
    
    % Calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
    SNR = (Pt * Gt_linear * Gr_linear * effective_area_m2) / (L_linear * N_linear * slantRange_m^4);
    
    % Convert SNR to dB
    SNR_dB = 6 * log10(SNR);
    
    % Calculate the probability of detection using the sigmoid function
    P_d = 1 / (1 + exp(-(SNR_dB - detection_threshold_dB)));
