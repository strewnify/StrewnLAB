% Step 1: Compute Monte Carlo Probability Density (Azimuth and Elevation)
az_bins = 0:1:360; % Azimuth bins (1-degree resolution)
elev_bins = 0.5:1:19.5; % Elevation bins (1-degree resolution)

% Voxelize the meteorite data into azimuth and elevation bins
[num_voxels, ~] = histcounts2(observations.observed_AZ, observations.observed_ELEV, az_bins, elev_bins);

% Normalize the voxel counts to get probability density
P_MonteCarlo = num_voxels / sum(num_voxels, 'all'); % Normalize to ensure total probability sums to 1

% Step 2: Compute Detection Probability for Each Meteorite
% Compute detection probability for each meteorite using NEXRAD function
P_detect = NEXRAD_detection_probability(observations.frontal_area, observations.slantRange_m); % Vectorized

% Step 3: Compute Weighted Probability Density
% Weight Monte Carlo probability density by detection probability for each meteorite
P_weighted = P_MonteCarlo .* P_detect; % Element-wise multiplication

% Step 4: Compute Intersection Probability (Beam Residence Time)
% Beam residence time function will be implemented later
% Placeholder for now: assume beam_residence_time is calculated later
residence_time = residence_time(observations); % Custom function

    % Calculate fraction of total sweep time
    detection_fraction = projected_width_deg ./ (360 .* n_sweeps)

% Normalize by the total sweep period of the radar
P_visible = residence_time ./ total_sweep_cycle_s; % Element-wise division

% Step 5: Compute Final Detection Probability
% Compute final detection probability for radar station/elevation angle
P_final = sum(P_weighted .* P_visible); % Sum over all meteorites
